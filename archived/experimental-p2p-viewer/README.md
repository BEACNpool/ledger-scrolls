# Experimental / Archived: P2P Viewer

This directory contains the original **Node-to-Node (N2N) / relay-based** prototype viewer.

Status: **ARCHIVED / EXPERIMENTAL**

Reason:
- The project is now **Koios-first** for reliability and accessibility.
- P2P/N2N relay requirements were too high for the intended open-source onboarding path.

If you want to revive this path, treat it as a research project.
